Lows Finding speed is a chore, sporty SR model has a choppy ride, optional sunroof reduces headroom. Verdict The Sentra is a comfortable and good-looking compact car, but it's not an above-average one."),
    Car(name: "Tesla_Model3", description: "The Model 3 gains speed smoothly and almost silently, with the electric motor providing strong power from a stop. And it's fast—extremely so in some trims. The rear-wheel-drive Long Range model we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 5.1 seconds."),
    Car(name: "Tesla_ModelS", description: "Model S is built from the ground up as an electric vehicle, with a high-strength architecture and floor-mounted battery pack for incredible occupant protection and low rollover risk. Every Model S includes Tesla's latest active safety features, such as Automatic Emergency Braking, at no extra cost."),
    Car(name: "Tesla_ModelX", description: "The Tesla Model X is a mid-size all-electric luxury crossover made by Tesla, Inc. The vehicle is notable in that it uses falcon-wing doors for passenger access."),
    Car(name: "Tesla_ModelY", description: "Model Y is capable in rain, snow, mud and off-road. Tesla All-Wheel Drive has two ultra-responsive, independent electric motors that digitally control torque to the front and rear wheels—for far better handling, traction and stability control. Model Y is capable in rain, snow, mud and off-road.")
